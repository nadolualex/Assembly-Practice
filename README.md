## Assembly Homework II

This repository hosts a collection of assembly code solutions for various exercises assigned as part of the second IOCLA homework. Let's delve into each exercise:

### Beaufort Encryption
Implement the Beaufort encryption algorithm, a variant of the Vigen√®re cipher. This encryption technique operates by subtracting the key's character value from the corresponding plaintext character value, looping back to 'Z' if the result is negative.

### Square Detection
Develop an algorithm to determine if a given number is a perfect square. This task involves iterating through numbers to check if the square of any integer equals the input number.

### Distance Between Points
Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points on a 2D plane. Utilize the Pythagorean theorem to compute the distance between the given points.

### Simple Encryption
Perform a simple encryption operation on a string of characters by shifting each character's ASCII value by a fixed step. If the shifted value exceeds the ASCII code for 'Z', wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet.

### Road Geometry
Compute the distances between consecutive points along a road. This task involves invoking a subroutine to calculate the distance between two points multiple times to determine the overall road distance.

Each exercise presents a unique challenge, offering opportunities to hone your assembly language skills and deepen your understanding of low-level programming concepts. Explore the code, understand the algorithms, and enhance your proficiency in assembly programming.
